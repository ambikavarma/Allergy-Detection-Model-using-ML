# Allergy-Detection-Model-using-ML

### Description:
Our project aims to develop a robust Allergy Detection Model, leveraging machine learning techniques to assess the allergen content of food products and provide users with vital information to make safe dietary choices. Allergies and dietary restrictions pose significant challenges for individuals, necessitating reliable tools to navigate food consumption safely. By integrating comprehensive data collection on food products, nutritional data, allergen ingredients, and user-reported allergic reactions, our model offers a practical solution to address these concerns.

### Key Components:
1. Data Collection: We compile extensive data on food products, including allergen ingredients, nutritional information, and reported allergic reactions, to train our model effectively.
2. Machine Learning Algorithms: We employ Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine algorithms to build predictive models that assess the likelihood of allergenic responses for a given food product.
3. Rule-based Technology: We incorporate rule-based techniques to match user inputs with known allergy reactions and allergens, enhancing the predictive insights provided by our model.
4. Performance Evaluation: We assess the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy ensuring its reliability and effectiveness in predicting allergen risks.

### Results:
- Our Support Vector Machine classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy at 75%, surpassing Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
- The integration of rule-based and machine learning techniques proves successful in providing predictive insights and addressing practical issues related to allergen detection.
- This project underscores the importance of combining various methodologies to tackle complex real-world problems effectively.

### Conclusion:
Our Allergy Detection Model represents a significant step towards ensuring the safety of individuals with allergies or dietary restrictions. By offering a comprehensive solution that merges rule-based and machine learning approaches, we provide users, healthcare professionals, and food manufacturers with a valuable resource to manage allergen-related concerns and promote safer dietary choices. This project's scalability and extensibility further enhance its utility, enabling the seamless integration of new data and features to adapt to evolving needs and challenges.
